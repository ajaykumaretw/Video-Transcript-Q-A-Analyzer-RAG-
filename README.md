1. App.py
Purpose:
Designed for handling video content analysis, specifically for smaller videos where synchronous processing is feasible.

Functionality:
Upload Video: Allows users to upload video files directly through the Streamlit interface.
Convert Video to Audio: Converts the uploaded video to an audio file (e.g., WAV) for further processing.
Transcribe Audio: Uses Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio from the video.
Upload to Pinecone: Converts the transcribed text into embeddings and uploads these embeddings along with metadata to Pinecone for indexing and retrieval.
Querying: Provides functionality for users to input queries related to the video content, retrieves relevant documents from Pinecone, and generates responses based on these documents.

Use Case:
Suitable for projects where video files are not too large, and synchronous processing is efficient.

2. AppLargeFile.py

Purpose:
Designed to handle both small and large video files efficiently using asynchronous processing.

Functionality:
Upload Video: Same as App.py, but the handling of large videos is more robust.
Convert Video to Audio: Converts video to audio, similar to App.py, but optimized for larger files.
Upload to Google Cloud Storage: Instead of handling the audio file directly, it uploads the audio to a Google Cloud bucket. This is useful for large files where local processing might be impractical.
Asynchronous Speech Recognition: Uses asynchronous processing to handle longer audio files without blocking the application. This involves using Google Cloud Speech-to-Textâ€™s long-running operations.
Upload to Pinecone: Converts the transcribed text into embeddings and uploads these to Pinecone, similar to App.py.
Querying: Allows users to query the transcribed content and generate responses based on the retrieved information from Pinecone.
Use Case:

Ideal for scenarios where video files are large, and processing needs to be handled in a way that avoids blocking operations or excessive resource usage.
Key Differences:
Processing Method: App.py handles videos synchronously, which is simple and direct but might not scale well with large files. AppLargeFile.py uses asynchronous processing to handle large files more efficiently.
Storage: AppLargeFile.py leverages Google Cloud Storage for storing large audio files, which is not utilized in App.py.
Speech Recognition: AppLargeFile.py uses asynchronous transcription methods, which are better suited for handling longer audio files and do not block the user interface.
Integration:
For Small Videos: You can use App.py to quickly and easily process small video files without the need for asynchronous handling.
For Large Videos: Switch to AppLargeFile.py to efficiently handle large files using asynchronous processing and Google Cloud Storage.
